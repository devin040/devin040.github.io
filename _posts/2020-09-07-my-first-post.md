I'm starting this blog/portfolio site with Jekyll. I don't know Ruby that well, so while I still have a lot to learn about the internals, I like how easy it is to generate this static site. I can stylize my resume with Github-flavored markdown, and use limited CSS styling. Adding a blog post, or any other page, is super easy, and I like that. I feel that using React or something for this would be too big of a hammer for this job. My strengths are *NOT* in UI / styling so having a simple site like this is just what I was looking for.
